# Lunkler's Data Packs

### What are these?

These are a series of what are called "data packs" for the video game Minecraft.
Data packs add and alter functionality of the base game, in a similar way mods
do, but with many more restrictions. All of my data packs are designed for
the Java edition of Minecraft, version 1.15 and higher.

My goal with these data packs is to add more use to underutilized blocks and items,
enhancing the game in a way that's consistent with the Vanilla experience.

### How do I use them?

1. Download the zip files from the (release section)[https://github.com/jordanranson/lunklers-data-packs/releases] on GitHub.
2. Find your (Minecraft directory)[https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/.minecraft]
3. Put the zipped file in `saves/<your world>/datapacks`
4. Check to see if the data pack is loaded in game by typing `/datapacks list`

You can enable and disable data packs in-game with the `/datapack enable|disable` commands.
You can also check to see which data packs are loaded with `/datapack list`, and can reload
changes without restarting the game with `/reload`.

### How can I contribute?

If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to create an issue on
GitHub. All of these data packs are under the GNU GPLv3 license so you're also free
to modify and distribute these packs as long as proper credit is given and your
data packs also remain open source.


## Lunkler's Compass GPS

Sure, the compass pointing to spawn can be useful, but lets face it, most of us
are bringing up the debug screen with F3 to constantly look up coordinates and
the direction we are facing. No more! With this data pack, when you have a compass
in your hand, your current coordinates and direction will be displayed above your
action bar. Now you can view coordinates in a "Vanilla" fashion, without resorting
to clunky debug screens!

This data pack was inspired by (JayList's HUD)[https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/jaylist-s-huds/] data pack.
